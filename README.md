### G'day ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoc in CSIRO Mineral Resources' Geoscience Analytics and Ore Deposit Petrology teams, working on leveraging large geochemical datasets with data science approaches and machine learning.

I principally work in Python, and wherever possible make what I'm doing open and as accessible as feasible. Feel free to get in touch with meabout:
-   potential collaborative projects
-   getting started with or contributing any of my current projects (see below)
-   ideas around making reproducible data analysis more accessible in the geosciences

### Software Projects

I'm currently working on a few open source Python packages, largely targeted towards geochemists:

-   [**`pyrolite`**](https://github.com/morganjwilliams/pyrolite)

    Python for geochemistry

-   [**`pyrolite-meltsutil`**](https://github.com/morganjwilliams/pyrolite-meltsutil)s

    A `pyrolite` extension for working with `alphaMELTS` and its outputs.

-   [**`interferences`**](https://github.com/morganjwilliams/interferences)

    Predicting isobaric interferences for geological mass spectrometry.

-   [**`autopew`**](https://github.com/morganjwilliams/autopew)

    2D coordinate transforms between analytical instrument stages and sample images.
